# MSFR_Numericalbenchmark_Data
As a part of my Ph.D. project I have applied an external coupling method implemented between OpenFOAM CFD solver and 
Serpent Monte-Carlo code to recreate the results of a numerical benchmark dedicated to the multiphysics codes for MSR modeling.
In this repository you will find all the raw data .csv files used to generate the plots for the MSFR Numerical Benchmark. 
The original benchmark paper can be found here:  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306454920301262
